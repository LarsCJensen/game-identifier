# Game Identifier

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Name to be decided, but this project is about being able to photograph a game cover, identify it through AI and search information about it and add it to a database.

## Background
It would be conventient to be able to just take a photo of a game, have it identified, and then populate a database with all information about release date, value, genre etc. It is not something that will move man forward perhaps, but for me as a game collector it would be cool!



## Data sources and AI Methods
I would probably use MobyGames and two other sources for information about the game and Ebay for statistics about current value. I would use image processing to identify the game and also text processing, perhaps bag of words, to search for ended actions. 

## How is it used?
Final goal might be to have a SaaS product where game collectors can take a picture of your game, add it to your game collection or perhaps just find out current value. I have not identified any ethical issues which should be addressed.

## Challenges
I am unsure how the data would be collected and how to match different platforms. The image processing would need to identify the name of the game as well as it's platform and perhaps also other aspects of the cover. The biggest challenge would probably be to get and interpret the data correctly.

## What next
Had I time I would pursue this project. 

## Acknowledgments
None, yet, but will make sure to give credit where it is due!
